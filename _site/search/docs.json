Gloucester City Council can provide guidance, but you must apply to the County Council for the road closure. ### How long in advance to apply Apply for road closure at least 6-8 weeks before your street party. ### Road closure signs You must put up 'Road Closed' signs at both ends of your street. You can: * Borrow signs from the council (check availability) * Hire signs from sign companies * Buy signs from suppliers (around £50 each) * Make banners (must be clearly visible) ### Emergency vehicle access You must keep a clear path at least 3 metres wide for fire engines and ambulances to get through if needed. ## What you need to do\n\n### Before the street party * **Tell your neighbours** – Give written notice to all nearby residents about your plans. Tell them the date, time, and how long the road will be closed. Include your contact details for questions * **Apply for road closure** – Apply to Gloucestershire County Council at least 6-8 weeks before * **Get signs** – Arrange 'Road Closed' signs for both ends of the street * **Consider a Temporary Event Notice** – If you are selling or supplying alcohol, you need a TEN (£21) * **Consider insurance** – Public liability insurance is not legally required for simple street parties, but you may want to get it. If you do, get at least £5 million cover ### During the street party * **Display road closure notice** – Show the official notice from the County Council * **Put up signs** – Place 'Road Closed' signs at both ends of your street * **Put marshals at closure points** – Have people at both ends to guide traffic and help residents who need to drive in or out * **Keep emergency access clear** – Make sure emergency vehicles can get through (at least 3 metres wide) * **Allow resident access** – Let residents drive in slowly with a walking marshal if they need to ### After the street party * **Remove signs and decorations** – Take down all signs, barriers and decorations * **Clear all rubbish** – Clean up the street * **Reopen the road** – Make sure the road is clear for traffic again ## Alcohol and licensing ### If drinks are free You do not need a licence if drinks are genuinely free. ### If you are selling drinks or tickets include drinks You need a Temporary Event Notice (TEN) if: * You are selling alcoholic drinks * Tickets to your event include drinks A TEN costs £21 and must be applied for at least 10 working days before your event.\n\n### Music You usually do not need a licence for background music at a street party.
