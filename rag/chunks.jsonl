Every home is put into a band based on what it was worth on 1 April 1991.\n\nThe amount you pay depends on which band your property is in and who lives there. Council tax helps pay for local services that benefit everyone in the community.\n\n## What your council tax pays for\n\nYour council tax bill includes charges from different organisations. Each one provides different services.\n\n### Gloucester City Council\n\nThe City Council uses its share to provide local services like:\n\n*   Waste collection and recycling\n*   Street cleaning\n*   Parks and open spaces\n*   Leisure facilities\n*   Environmental health\n*   Planning and building control\n*   Housing services\n\n### Gloucestershire County Council\n\nThe County Council gets the largest share and provides services like:\n\n*   Adult social care\n*   Children's services\n*   Schools and education\n*   Highways and transport\n*   Libraries\n*   Trading standards\n*   Fire and rescue\n\n### Police and Crime Commissioner\n\nThis part of your bill pays for police services across Gloucestershire.\n\n### Parish or Town Councils\n\nSome areas have an extra charge for parish or town councils (like Quedgeley). They provide very local services like:\n\n*   Community facilities\n*   Local parks and playgrounds\n*   Village halls\n\n## The council tax year\n\nCouncil tax runs for a financial year, from 1 April to 31 March the following year.\n\nYour bill shows the full year's charge. You can choose to pay in 10 monthly instalments (April to January) or 12 monthly instalments (April to March).\n\n## The law and council tax\n\n### Legal basis\n\nCouncil tax is set by law under the Local Government Finance Act 1992. This means we must charge council tax on all homes, and people must pay it."}

They then set the council tax charge to help cover these costs.\n\nThe amount is agreed by:\n\n*   Gloucester City Council (for city services)\n*   Gloucestershire County Council (for county services)\n*   The Police and Crime Commissioner (for police services)\n*   Your parish or town council (if you have one)\n\n#### Limits on increases\n\nThe government sets limits on how much councils can increase council tax each year. If a council wants to increase it by more than the limit, they must hold a local vote (referendum).\n\n## Who sets your band\n\nYour property's council tax band is set by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), which is part of central government. The council does not set bands.\n\nBands are based on what your property was worth on 1 April 1991, not what it's worth now. This is the same for all properties in England.\n\n[See all council tax bands](https://gloucester.gov.uk/council-tax/bands.html)\n\n## Who has to pay\n\nCouncil tax is a property tax. The person who lives in the property (or owns it if it's empty) must pay.\n\n### Order of liability\n\nIf more than one person could be responsible, we use this order to decide:\n\n1.  A resident who owns the property (freeholder)\n2.  A resident who is a leaseholder\n3.  A resident who is a tenant\n4.  A resident with a licence to live there\n5.  Any other resident\n6.  The owner (if no one lives there)\n\n**Example:** If you own and live in your home, you pay. If you rent, you (the tenant) pay, not the landlord.\n\n[More about liability when you move](https://gloucester.gov.uk/council-tax/moving.html)\n\n## Exemptions and discounts\n\nSome people and properties can get reductions on their council tax."}

For example:\n\n*   Properties lived in only by full-time students\n*   Properties that cannot legally be lived in\n*   Annexes lived in by elderly or disabled relatives\n\n### Discounts\n\nSome situations qualify for a discount. For example:\n\n*   25% off if you live alone (single person discount)\n*   Disabled band reduction if you need extra space\n\n[See all discounts and exemptions](https://gloucester.gov.uk/council-tax/discounts.html)\n\n## Council Tax Support\n\nCouncil Tax Support is different from discounts and exemptions. It's a benefit that helps people on low incomes pay their council tax.\n\nYou can get Council Tax Support even if you're working. The amount you get depends on your income, savings, and circumstances.\n\n[Find out about Council Tax Support](https://gloucester.gov.uk/council-tax/support.html)\n\n## What happens if you don't pay\n\nCouncil tax is not optional. By law, you must pay it if you're liable.\n\nIf you don't pay, we have legal powers to collect what you owe. This can include:\n\n*   Court action to get a liability order\n*   Using enforcement agents (bailiffs)\n*   Taking money from your wages or benefits\n\n**Having trouble paying?** Contact us as soon as possible.

This is a full exemption, not a discount.\n\n**Key point:** If everyone in your property is a full-time student, no one has to pay council tax. The property is exempt.\n\n## Who qualifies as a full-time student\n\nYou are a full-time student for council tax purposes if your course meets these conditions:\n\n### Course duration\n\nYour course must last at least 1 academic year (or 1 calendar year if it is not based on academic years).\n\n### Study hours\n\nYou must study for at least 21 hours per week during term time. This includes lectures, tutorials, practical work, and supervised study.\n\n### Recognised institution\n\nYour course must be at a recognised educational establishment, such as a university or college.\n\n**This includes:**\n\n*   University undergraduate and postgraduate courses\n*   Higher education courses at colleges\n*   Some vocational courses (if they meet the 21 hours per week rule)\n\n## If you live with non-students\n\nIf you are a full-time student but live with people who are not students, the rules are different:\n\n### One student, one non-student\n\nThe non-student has to pay council tax. However, because only one adult counts (the student does not count), the non-student can get a 25% single person discount.\n\n**Example:** You are a student and live with your partner who works. Your partner pays council tax but gets 25% off because you do not count as an adult for council tax purposes.\n\n### Multiple students with one non-student\n\nIf several students live with one non-student, the non-student has to pay the full council tax bill (no discount).\n\n**Example:** Three students and one working person share a house. The working person pays the full council tax. The students do not pay anything.\n\n### Two or more non-students\n\nIf two or more non-students live in the property, they share the full council tax bill. Students living there do not pay anything and do not reduce the bill."}
